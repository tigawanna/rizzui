We're excited to announce **RizzUI 2.1.0**, a maintenance release that introduces our custom `createVariant` system, fixes TypeScript type issues, and resolves minor component bugs. This release replaces the dependency on `tailwind-variants` with our own production-ready variant system.

### Custom createVariant System

RizzUI 2.1.0 introduces our own **custom variant system** built from the ground up. The `createVariant` function is a type-safe, production-ready alternative to `tailwind-variants`, providing full TypeScript inference and zero runtime dependencies (except for the `cn` utility).

**Key Features:**

- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript inference with no type assertions needed
- **Zero dependencies** - No external variant library required
- **Slots support** - Built-in support for multi-part components
- **Compound variants** - Support for conditional styling based on multiple variants
- **Boolean variants** - Native support for boolean variants with `true`/`false` keys

**Example Usage:**

```tsx
import { createVariant, type VariantProps } from 'rizzui/variants';

// Regular variants
const button = createVariant({
  base: 'px-4 py-2 rounded-md font-medium',
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground',
      outline: 'border border-border bg-transparent',
    },
    size: {
      sm: 'h-8 px-2 text-xs',
      md: 'h-9 px-3 text-sm',
      lg: 'h-10 px-4 text-base',
    },
    disabled: {
      true: 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    variant: 'primary',
    size: 'md',
  },
});

// Slots variants (for multi-part components)
const alert = createVariant({
  slots: {
    root: 'relative block w-full',
    bar: 'absolute left-0 top-0',
    content: '',
  },
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {
        root: 'px-2.5 py-2',
        content: 'ps-6',
      },
      md: {
        root: 'px-4 py-3',
        content: 'ps-8',
      },
    },
  },
  compoundVariants: [
    { color: 'danger', class: { root: 'border-muted' } },
    { color: 'danger', class: { bar: 'bg-red' } },
  ],
});

// Type inference works perfectly
type ButtonProps = VariantProps<typeof button>;
```

The `createVariant` system is now used internally by all RizzUI components and is also available as a public API for creating your own variant-driven components.

#### IntelliSense

You can enable autocompletion inside `createVariant` using the steps below:

**Visual Studio Code:**

1. Install the ["Tailwind CSS IntelliSense"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) Visual Studio Code extension

2. Add the following to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.classFunctions": ["cn", "createVariant"]
}
```

This will provide full IntelliSense support for Tailwind classes when using `createVariant` and the `cn` utility function, making it easier to write and maintain your variant definitions.

<br />

### No More tailwind-variants Dependency

RizzUI 2.1.0 **removes the dependency on `tailwind-variants`**. We've built our own variant system that:

- **Reduces bundle size** - No external variant library in your bundle
- **Better type safety** - Custom types designed specifically for RizzUI's needs
- **More control** - Full control over the variant system's behavior and features
- **Better performance** - Optimized for our specific use cases

If you were using `tailwind-variants` directly in your codebase, you can now use `createVariant` from `rizzui/variants` instead, which provides the same API with better TypeScript support.

**Migration:**

```tsx
// Before (using tailwind-variants)
import { tv } from 'tailwind-variants';

// After (using RizzUI's createVariant)
import { createVariant } from 'rizzui/variants';
```

The API is compatible, so migration is straightforward. Simply replace `tv` with `createVariant` and update your imports.

<br />

### Fixed Variant Type Definitions

RizzUI 2.1.0 fixes several TypeScript type issues in the variant system:

#### Fixed SlotsVariants Type

The `SlotsVariants` type now correctly matches the nested structure used in slots variants:

```typescript
// Fixed type definition
type SlotsVariants<TVariants extends Variants = Variants> = {
  [K in keyof TVariants]: Record<string | number, Record<string, string>>;
};
```

This ensures that components like `FileInput`, `Alert`, and other slots-based components have correct TypeScript types without compilation errors.

#### Fixed SlotsCompoundVariant Type

The `SlotsCompoundVariant` type has been enhanced to properly support compound variants with slot-specific classes:

```typescript
type SlotsCompoundVariant<TVariants extends Variants = Variants> = {
  [K in keyof TVariants]?: keyof TVariants[K] | boolean;
} & {
  class?: string | Record<string, string> | any;
};
```

This allows you to apply different classes to different slots when multiple variant conditions are met, with full type safety.

**Example:**

```tsx
const alert = createVariant({
  slots: {
    root: 'relative block',
    bar: 'absolute left-0',
    content: '',
  },
  variants: {
    color: {
      danger: {},
      info: {},
    },
  },
  compoundVariants: [
    { color: 'danger', class: { root: 'border-muted', bar: 'bg-red' } },
    { color: 'info', class: { bar: 'bg-blue' } },
  ],
});
```

These fixes eliminate the need for `@ts-ignore` comments and provide better autocomplete and error checking in your IDE.

<br />

### Migration from 2.0.0

RizzUI 2.1.0 is a **drop-in replacement** for RizzUI 2.0.0. No code changes are required - simply update your dependency:

```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add rizzui@2.1.0

# Using npm
npm install rizzui@2.1.0

# Using yarn
yarn add rizzui@2.1.0
```

**Note:** If you were using `tailwind-variants` directly in your codebase, you can now use `createVariant` from `rizzui/variants` instead. The API is compatible, so you can simply replace `tv` with `createVariant`.

If you were using `@ts-ignore` comments to work around variant type issues, you can now remove them as these issues have been resolved.

<br />

### What's Next

RizzUI 2.1.0 continues to improve the foundation laid in 2.0.0. We're committed to:

- Further enhancing the variant system
- Improving developer experience with better TypeScript support
- Adding more components and features
- Maintaining backward compatibility

We're excited to see what you build with RizzUI 2.1.0! If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/rizzui/rizzui).
